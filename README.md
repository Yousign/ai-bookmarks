A curated compilation of Artifical Intelligence resources

## üìö Learning and understanding AI

### Books
- [AI Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/?irclickid=0C%3A2sAVLrxyPRgUwAU2uW2grUkswTeT420JAyI0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=new%20release&utm_content=book%20ai%20engineering%2020240910) - The book starts with an overview of AI engineering, explaining how it differs from traditional ML engineering and discussing the new AI stack. The more AI is used, the more opportunities there are for catastrophic failures, and therefore, the more important evaluation becomes. This book discusses different approaches to evaluating open-ended models, including the rapidly growing AI-as-a-judge approach.
